# Flat-Blocks
  Flat Blocks is a resource pack that transforms block's item models into actual item models.

  Some blocks contain different tints or NBT data that I don't know how to take into consideration using the item models, so blocks like the Decorated Pot can't have their faces displaying the pottery shards, and the Grass Block, which has tint, tints the whole texture, an not just the overlay texture.

  There will be also a Flat Compats addon for this resource pack, which will have compatibility for many mods, some of which are actually being worked on. Some have full support, like Iron Chests, and some have partial support, like Storage Drawers
  Here's a full list of the mods, having partial [P] or full [F] support:
  - Create [P] and Create Chunkloading [F]
  - Storage Drawers [P]
  - Mob Grinding Utils [P]
  - Iron Chests [F]
  - Mystical Agriculure [P] and Aggraditions [P]
  - Silent Gear [P?]
  - Farmer's Delight [P]
  - Refined Storage [P]
 
  Here's the release notes for each version:

  Flat Blocks for 23w07a:
