# Flat-Blocks
Flat Blocks is a resource pack that transforms block's item models into actual item models.

Some blocks contain different tints or NBT data that I don't know how to take into consideration using the item models, so blocks like the Decorated Pot can't have their faces displaying the pottery shards, and the Grass Block, which has tint, tints the whole texture, an not just the overlay texture.
